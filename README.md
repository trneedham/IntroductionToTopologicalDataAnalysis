# IntroductionToTopologicalDataAnalysis

This is a special lecture as part of the Code programming bootcamp https://www.erdosinstitute.org/code.

The goal is to give an introduction to the field of topological data analysis (TDA), including a light introduction to the theory and some hands-on examples using TDA packages in Python.

The intended audience is graduate students, postdocs and researchers in quantitative fields who have not necessarily had prior exposure to topology. 

To run the included Jupyter notebooks, one must first install the packages `ripser` https://ripser.scikit-tda.org and `persim` http://persim.scikit-tda.org, as well as standard scientific programming packages. Alternatively, one can install `scikit-tda` https://scikit-tda.org, which includes the aforementioned packages.
